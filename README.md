# Next.js Links Not Working in Production

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where links work fine in development but fail in production. The problem arises from incorrect configuration of the `basePath` setting and how it interacts with link generation. The solution showcases the correct way to handle relative and absolute paths in links for consistent behavior across all environments.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Deploy to Vercel or another platform.
